# ny_demographics_sat_tests_analysis

This project analyzes which factors affect the SAT scores of students across different schools in New York. In the Schools.ipynb file, I cleaned and merged all the datasets uploaded to this repo; I have also performed different analyses that reveal interesting conclusions from the data. 

All the datasets are from https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/.

combined.csv is the cleaned up, merged file that combines all the other datasets in a useful manner.
