# ny_demographics_sat_tests_analysis

This project analyzes which factors affect the SAT scores of students across different schools in New York. In the Schools.ipynb file I clean and merge all the datasets uploaded to this repo and do different analyses that reveal interesting conclusions from the data. 

All the datasets are from https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/.
